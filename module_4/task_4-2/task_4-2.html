      <li>What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!</li>
      <p>Data structure which stores a collection of items. The items can be numbers or other data types, and they accessed by their index in the array.</p>
      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
        coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding")</li>
      <p>Embedding fixed values directly in the code instead of for example variables. It makes the code less flexible.</p>
      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.</li>
      <p>The sentence is split into an array of words. We traverse the array by using a loop. We find the index dynamically because the loop adjusts automatically based on the number of elements..</p>
      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?</li>
      <p>It allows for organized and efficient management of multiple objects. It enables operations like iterations and sorting while making use of the shared behavior and properties in the class.</p>
