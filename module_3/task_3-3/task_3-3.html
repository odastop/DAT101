      <li>What is the difference between invoking and creating a function? </li>
      <p>Creating a function involves defining it, which means specifying what the function will do when called. Invoking a function means executing or calling a function which has already been defined.</p>

      <li>Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks.</li>
      <p>Semicolons are used to end statements in Javascript. Code blocks are groups of statements within curly brackets.</p>

      <li>What happens when we try to store values from a function when it doesn't return any? </li>
      <p>The function will return "undefined" when called. If the value is used in further logic or calculations it can lead to errors.</p>

      <li>How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function? </li>
      <p>The parameters are separated by commas within parentheses in the function declaration.</p>

      <li> Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation and creation of a function. </li>
      <p>The parameter names act as place holders for values in the function declaration. When you invoke a function, you pass values that are assigned to the parameters. The order of the values in the calling of the function corresponds to the order of the parameters in the declaration.</p>

      <li>Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call is missing a parameter. </li>
      <p>When a function is called without all the involving parameters, the code will assign "undefined to any missing arguments. This is because Javascript functions don't require the exact number of arguments to parameters. This can lead to errors in some cases.</p>

      <li>Explain what happens when we use recursive functions. </li>
      <p>A recursive function is a function which calls itself as part of its process. The function call creates a new execution until it reaches a stopping condition. Without a break point the recursion will go on indefinitely.</p>
