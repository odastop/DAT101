      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>When the wake up time is exactly 7, the if condition is true, and the message about taking the bus is printed. If the condition is false, the number is any other than 7, there is no alternate action and the program will not return any value.</p>

      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If the wake up time is 7, the message about the bus will be printed. We have now added an else action to our statement, which will print for every other value. </p>

      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p> When the wake up time is less than 7 or greater than 8, the else block of the code is executed, and the person needs to take the car to school.</p>

      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>In part 4, the statement for the number 0 is not yet added. That means that there is no code that checks for the value 0, and the program will not return a value or print anything for that number. For the positive and negative numbers the program will print positive or negative accordingly. Zero is neither positive or negative, but rather a boundary between the two. It is a neutral and unique case.</p>
